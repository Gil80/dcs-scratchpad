# DCS Scratchpad

Resizable and movable DCS World in-game Scratchpad for quick persistent notes - especially useful in VR.

## Installation

Copy the `Scripts` folder into your DCS Saved games folder.

## Usage

- Toggle the scratchpad with `CTRL+Shift+X`
- Use `Esc` to remove the text field focus, but keep the scratchpad open

## Settings

Some settings can be changed in your DCS saved games folder under `Config/ScratchpadConfig.lua` (if the file does not exist, start DCS once after mod installation):

- `hotkey` change the hotkey used to toggle the scratchpad
- `fontSize` increase or decrease the font size of the Scratchpads textarea

## Scratchpad Content

The Scratchpads content is persisted into `Scratchpad\0000.txt` (in your saved games folder; if the file does not exist, start DCS once after mod installation/upgrade). You can also change the file in your favorite text editor before starting DCS.

## Kudos

- to [DCS-SimpleRadioStandalone](https://github.com/ciribob/DCS-SimpleRadioStandalone) which acted as a good reference of how to setup a simple window in DCS
